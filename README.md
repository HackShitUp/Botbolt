Botbolt is an interactive 2d game written in Swift using Apple's SpriteKit and SceneKit SDK. This project was made for Intro To Video Game Design with Professor Lawrence Wolk. 

## Game Objective
The objective of the game is simple â€” simply attempt to grab as many *lightning bolts* and avoid existing enemies. The main character, _Bot_, is an inspired character from the existing game, _Boost Buddies_. It's assets were rendered from a sticker package available on the iOS iMessage App Store.
